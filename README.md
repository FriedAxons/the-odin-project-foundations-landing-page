The Odin Projects Foundations Landing Page Project

A webpage from the designs provided is being built from scratch.
The skills learned up until this point will be tested and used in this project to complete it.

One design is an image of the complete website, the outcome. And the other has some details about some of the fonts and colors that were used for the end result.

The goal for this project is to get it as close as possible to the design, though not worrying about a pixel-perfect design. The point of this assignment is **to create something from scratch and get the various elements in more or less the right position relative to the rest.**
