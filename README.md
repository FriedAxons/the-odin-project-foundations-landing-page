## The Odin Project Foundations Landing Page

This is one of the first main projects given on [theodinproject](www.theodinproject.com).

The goal is to create an entire web page as close as you can to a design template that was provided from the course lesson.
The [first](https://cdn.statically.io/gh/TheOdinProject/curriculum/main/foundations/html_css/project/odin-project.png) image provided was the full design of what the end result should look similar to.
The [second](https://cdn.statically.io/gh/TheOdinProject/curriculum/main/foundations/html_css/project/colors_and_stuff.png) image provided was information on the color and fonts that were used for the web page.
